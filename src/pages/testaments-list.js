        </dt>
        <dd>
          Disturbed from their slumber when their temple was violated and a
          great sacrilege committed, the 'gods who are rejected' burn with
          unholy anger at the humans who tossed them aside. But an eternal curse
          upon the one who committed the sacrilege is not enough &hellip; the
          gods demand retribution upon all humanity and call upon their high
          priest, Mobedān Mobed, to tear open the barrier between their realm of
          nightmars and the realm of humanity so that they can enter and plunge
          the world into a new eternal darkness.
